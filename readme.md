# AI-powered Cybersecurity Threat Detector

## Overview

The AI-powered Cybersecurity Threat Detector is a web-based application designed to detect network traffic anomalies using machine learning models. The app enables users to upload CSV files containing network traffic data, which are then analyzed for any unusual behavior, identified as anomalies, or classified as normal traffic. The application visualizes the results with interactive charts and provides statistical data on anomaly detection.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload CSV files containing network traffic data for analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects anomalies using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Visualization**: Displays anomaly detection results in the form of pie charts and other graphical visualizations.
- **Statistics**: Shows the count of normal and anomalous behaviors.
- **Downloadable Results**: Users can download the analysis results.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and Chart.js for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Provides users with AI-based assistance and explanations for detected anomalies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend development using Flask for web framework.
- **Flask**: Web framework for Python to handle the app’s routes and logic.
- **Chart.js**: Visualization library used to create interactive charts for anomaly detection.
- **Tailwind CSS**: CSS framework for building a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained models used for anomaly detection in network traffic data.
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine used for dynamic content rendering in HTML templates.
- **Gemini API**: Used for integrating a chatbot to assist users with analysis and explanations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NIKK-666/AI-hackfest.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cybersec-threat-detector
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the app.

## Usage

- **Upload a CSV File**: The CSV file should contain network traffic data (e.g., columns for source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.).
- **Analyze**: Once the file is uploaded, the system will analyze the data and display the anomaly detection results.
- **View Results**: The app will show pie charts and statistics about normal and anomalous behaviors detected in the network traffic data.
- **Download Results**: After analysis, you can download the results of the detection.

## Chatbot Integration

This project features an integrated AI-based chatbot to help users with understanding the results of the anomaly detection. The chatbot provides detailed explanations and insights into the detection process, helping users interpret the findings more easily.
